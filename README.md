# TestJudge
TREC Deep Learning Full Synthetic Test Collection

## Prompt
`prompt.txt` contains the prompt that we used for the relevance judgment generation. This prompt template is inspired by Thomas et al. [1] recent paper on search prefenrce predictions using LLMs.

## Qrels
The qrels files can be found in the `./qrels/` folder. The qrels folder includes two qrel files. The files are with the same format of TREC DL: tab-seprated and similir columns:

> qid 0 docid score

- __DL-LLM_qrels_pass.txt__: This is the full synthetic qrel file.
- __DL-LLM_qrels_pass_withHuman.txt__: This qrel includes synthetic qrels based on our depth-10 pooling synthetic qrel construction and human qrels from all 5 years labelled by NIST assessors.
